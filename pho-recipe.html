        Making your own fabulous bowl of Vietnamese pho at home is not hard,
        all you need is a straightforward recipe, a few secrets and a nice
        big stockpot. We realize our recipe may look daunting, but this is
        quite simple to do and there is a lot of inactive time while you
        wait for the broth (we’ve just been extra tedious to share
        everything we know).

    <h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
    <p><strong>MAKE BROTH</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add beef bones to a large pot that will hold at least 10 quarts. Then,
        cover bones with cold water. Place pot onto high heat and bring to a
        boil. Boil for 3 to 5 minutes. During this time, impurities and foam
        (or scum) will be released and rise to the top. Drain bones,
        discarding the water. Then, rinse bones with warm water and scrub
        stockpot to remove any residue that has stuck to the sides. Add the
        bones back to the stockpot and cover with 6 quarts of cold water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, move an oven rack to a high position then turn broiler to
        high. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place quartered onions
        and halved ginger onto baking sheet then broil for 10 to 15 minutes,
        turning onions and ginger occasionally so that they become charred or
        browned on all sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add cinnamon sticks, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, star anise, cloves
        and the black cardamom pod to a dry frying pan. Place onto low heat
        and cook, stirring occasionally until fragrant. About 5 minutes. Place
        toasted spices into a cotton muslin bag/herb sachet or cheesecloth
        then tie with butchers twine to seal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring stockpot with parboiled bones and water to a boil then lower to
        a gentle simmer. Add charred onion and ginger as well as the bag or
        sachet of toasted spices. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of salt, a 1/4 cup of
        fish sauce and the rock sugar. Continue to simmer broth, uncovered,
        for 3 hours. If at any time foam or scum rises to the surface, use a
        spoon to remove it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use tongs or a wide mesh spoon to remove bones, onion and ginger from
        broth then strain broth through a fine mesh strainer. The broth will
        have a layer of fat at the the top. There are two ways to remove this.
        First, if you plan to enjoy the broth now, skim the fat from the top
        of the broth using a spoon. If you do not mind waiting, you can also
        pour broth into containers then refrigerate overnight. As the broth
        cools, the fat will solidify, making it very easy to remove.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>ASSEMBLY</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring the broth to a gentle simmer over medium heat.</li>
      <li>
        If you are using dried noodles, add noodles to a bowl then cover with
        hot water and soak for 15 to 20 minutes until soft and opaque. If you
        are using fresh, add to a colander then rinse with cold water.
      </li>
      <li>
        To cook the noodles, bring a medium saucepan filled with water to a
        boil. Place noodles into boiling water and cook for about 10 seconds
        or until they collapse. Drain noodles then divide between bowls. (We
        like to fill each bowl by 1/3 with noodles).
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange slices of raw meat into bowls, and then top with the hot
        broth. Finish broth with onion slices and cilantro. Serve bowls with a
        plate of optional garnishes listed above.
